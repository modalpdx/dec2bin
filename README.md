# "dec2bin"
A school project for converting decimal numbers to binary.

##How the program works:

The user is prompted for a decimal number to convert to binary, then the
32 bit binary value of the number is presented. The program does not
repeat.

##Build:

Download everything and run "make." The Makefile requires GNU make, of
course, as well as GCC.

##Colophon:

This program was written 100% in C with standards in mind. It has been
built and tested on Linux and Mac OS.

##Disclaimer:

This is code from a school project. It satisfies assignment requirements
but is nowhere near as "scrubbed" as released software should be.
Security is not addressed, only functionality and no input validation. The
assignment scope was limited so there are bound to be issues and quirks.

If you use this code for anything other than satisfying your curiosity,
please keep the following in mind:

- there is no warranty of any kind (you use the code as-is)
- there is no support offered, please do not ask
- there is no guarantee it'll work, although it's not complex so it should
  work
- please do not take credit for code you did not write, especially if you
  are a student. NO CHEATING.

Thanks!
